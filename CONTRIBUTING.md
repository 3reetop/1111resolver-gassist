# Contribution Guide
You can contribute to this project in the following ways:

## Bug Hunting/Testing
I'm accepting signups for Alpha testing! To signup, you can either:

- [Message me on Keybase](https://keybase.io/xdrixxyz)  (preferred way, faster response time)
- [Make an issue on this repository](https://github.com/xDrixxyz/1111resolver-gassist/issues/new) (slower response time)

Right now we have a maximum cap of testers allowed to test at once, imposed on us by Google, which is set to `20`.

Soon we'll get a link which you'll be able to click on to join the program instead of giving me your email.

## Code contributions
If you know Node.js, have experience building Actions on Google projects, and love to code, then you can contribute code to this project!

Simply fork this repository, add & commit your code, push it to your fork, and create a pull request!

I'll decide if your PR is good enough to merge and we can discuss improvements and additions!

## Monetary contributions
Listen, this project is just something I made in my free time. I pay for the hosting of the code in this repository on a Firebase Cloud Function. In addition to having to pay for hosting, any and all external requests coming from my function to any destination that is not a Google server is also billed. This means the DNS queries are billed. Every single one of them.

So if you could help me monetarily, I would love you so much (no homo tho). If you're interested:

- I have a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/xdrixxyz)
- I have a [Bitcoin address](bitcoin:dfjkshfkh)
- I have a **Stellar Lumens federation address**: `xdrixxyz*keybase.io`
- I have a **Stellar Lumens wallet address**: `gg`
- I have a **PayPal**: `mcminers9@gmail.com

Again, whatever you can contribute will be greatly appreciated and put 100% towards the growth, improvement, and maintenance of this and my other projects.
